# Workforce Planning Model Solution

Welcome to the Workforce Planning Model Solution repository! This repository contains an Excel-based model designed to help HR professionals and business analysts determine the optimal number of recruiters needed to support organizational growth across multiple departments over a three-year period.

## Overview

This model provides a comprehensive framework for workforce planning, enabling users to analyze department-specific growth and attrition rates and align recruitment strategies with overall business goals. By leveraging advanced Excel functions and dynamic pivot tables, this model facilitates accurate workforce calculations and data-driven decision-making.

## Key Features

- **Dynamic Visualizations:** Pivot tables and charts automatically update to reflect changes in growth and attrition rates, providing clear visual insights into recruitment needs.
- **Advanced Excel Formulas:** Utilizes powerful Excel functions such as `VLOOKUP`, `SUMPRODUCT`, and `INDEX/MOD` to perform complex calculations and automate data analysis.
  - **Example Formulas:**
    - `VLOOKUP`: Matches and retrieves relevant data across different sheets.
    - `SUMPRODUCT(--(x=x1), y)`: Performs conditional summation to calculate total recruitment needs based on specific conditions.
    - `INDEX` and `MOD` combination: Dynamically cycles through data ranges, useful for repeating patterns or creating sequences.
- **User-Friendly Design:** Organized with clearly labeled sheets, structured data, and annotations to guide users through the model's functionalities.
- **Scenario Analysis:** Allows users to adjust key inputs (such as growth and attrition rates) and immediately see the impact on recruitment needs through dynamically updated tables and charts.

## Purpose
